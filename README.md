# Simple java poker game

## Overview:

The rules of the game are that you (and the computer) each get 10 tokens at the start of the Poker session.   
For each round of poker, each of you are dealt 5 cards from the deck. You then decide if you, or the dealer, can, and want to “open” the game, in that order. If one of you does so, you each have to put 1 token “into the pot”. (The computer should default to ‘opening’ if it has a qualifying hand, but you can decide to proceed or not as the other player)
Then you can specify the cards you would like to re-fresh in your hand (to a maximum of 4). Likewise the dealer can refresh their hand, up to four cards (the computer can default to “random selection of cards to discard”, but any more sophistication would be a bonus).  
After that, you can bet a number of tokens (0-3) and the computer can decide to let you win or ‘see’ your cards. If it lets you win, you get all the tokens in the pot. If it ‘sees you’, then it matches your bet and the best hand wins, taking all the tokens ‘in the pot’. (Again, the computer’s responses can be quite basic in that, for example, it might to only go forward if it has 2 pairs or better)  
The game ends when the (non-computer) player decides it does or when one of the players has lost all their tokens.  
The winning order of hands in poker is:  
•	A royal flush (a straight flush starting at Ace and going down through King, Queen, Jack, to Ten)  
•	A straight flush (a straight but all in the same suit – the higher the better)
•	Four of a kind (the higher the better)  
•	A flush (all the same suit - the higher the better)  
•	A straight (for example “4 clubs, 5 spades, 6 clubs, 7 diamond, 8 spades” - the higher the better)  
•	A full house (triplets and a pair - the higher the triplets, the better)  
•	Triplets (the higher the better)  
•	2 pairs (the higher the better)  
•	1 pair (the higher the better)   
To ‘open you need a pair of jacks or better in the above list.
